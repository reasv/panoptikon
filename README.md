## State-of-the-Art, Local, Multimodal, Multimedia Search Engine

Panoptikon indexes your local files using state-of-the-art AI and machine learning models, making difficult-to-search media such as images and videos easily findable.

Combining OCR, Whisper Speech-to-Text, CLIP image embeddings, text embeddings, full-text search, automated tagging, and automated image captioning, Panoptikon is the _Swiss Army knife_ of local media indexing.

Panoptikon aims to be the `text-generation-webui` or `stable-diffusion-webui` of local search. It is fully customizable, allowing you to easily configure custom models for any of the supported tasks. It comes with a wealth of capable models available out of the box, and adding another one or updating to a newer fine-tune is never more than a few TOML configuration lines away.

As long as a model is supported by any of the built-in implementation classes (supporting, among others, OpenCLIP, Sentence Transformers, Faster Whisper, and Florence 2 via HF Transformers), you can simply add it to the inference server configuration by specifying the Hugging Face repo, and it will immediately be available for use.

Panoptikon is designed to keep index data produced by multiple different models (or different configurations of the same model) **side by side**, letting you choose which one(s) to use _at search time_. As such, Panoptikon is an excellent tool for comparing the real-world performance of different methods of data extraction or embedding models, and allows you to leverage their combined power instead of relying on the accuracy of only one.

For example, when searching with a given tag, you can pick multiple tagging models from a list and choose whether to match an item if at least one model has set the tag(s) you're searching for, or require that all of them have.

The intended use of Panoptikon is for power users and more technically minded enthusiasts to leverage more capable and/or custom-trained open-source models to index and search their files. Unlike tools such as Hydrus, Panoptikon will never copy, move, or otherwise touch your data. You only need to add your directories to the list of allowed paths and run the indexing jobs.

Panoptikon will build an index inside its own SQLite database, referencing the original source file paths. Files are kept track of by their hash, so there's no issue with renaming or moving them around after they've been indexed. You only need to make sure to re-run the file scan job after moving or renaming files to update the index with the new paths. It's also possible to configure Panoptikon to automatically re-scan directories at regular intervals through the cron job feature.

### Warning

Panoptikon is designed to be used as a local service and is not intended to be exposed to the internet. It does not currently have any authentication features and exposes, among other things, an API that can be abused for remote code execution on your host machine. Panoptikon binds to localhost by default, and if you intend to expose it, you should add a reverse proxy with authentication such as HTTP Basic Auth or OAuth2 in front of it.

### Public Instance (panoptikon.dev)

The **only** configuration that we endorse for a public Panoptikon instance is the provided docker-compose file, which exposes two separate services running on ports 6339 and 6340, respectively. The former is meant to be exposed publicly and blocks access to all dangerous APIs, while the second one is to be used as a private admin panel and has no restrictions on usage or API access. There is no authentication, although HTTP Basic Auth can easily be added to the Nginx configuration file if needed.

This exact docker-compose configuration is currently running at [panoptikon.dev](https://panoptikon.dev/search) as a public demonstration instance for users to try Panoptikon before installing it locally. Certain features, such as the ability to open files and folders in the file manager, have been disabled in the public instance for security reasons.

Panoptikon is also not designed with high concurrency in mind, and the public instance may be slow or unresponsive at times if many users are accessing it simultaneously, especially when it comes to the inference server and related semantic search features. This is because requests to the inference server's prediction endpoint are not debounced, and the instant search box will make a request for every keystroke.

The public instance is meant for demonstration purposes only, to show the capabilities of Panoptikon to interested users. If you wanted to host a public Panoptikon instance for real-world use, it would be necessary to add authentication and rate limiting to the API, optimize the inference server for high concurrency, and possibly add a caching layer.

> 💡 Panoptikon's search API is not tightly coupled to the inference server. It is possible to implement a caching layer or a distributed queue system to handle inference requests more efficiently. Without modifying Panoptikon's source code, you could use a different inference server implementation that scales better, then simply pass the embeddings it outputs to Panoptikon's search API.

> ℹ️ The public instance currently contains a small subset of images from the [latentcat/animesfw](https://huggingface.co/datasets/latentcat/animesfw) dataset.

Although large parts of the API are disabled in the public instance, you can still consult the full API documentation at [panoptikon.dev/docs](https://panoptikon.dev/docs).

## REST API

Panoptikon exposes a REST API that can be used to interact with the search and bookmarking functionality programmatically, as well as to retrieve the indexed data, the actual files, and their associated metadata. Additionally, `inferio`, the inference server, exposes an API under `/api/inference` that can be used to run batch inference using the available models.

The API is documented in the OpenAPI format. The interactive documentation generated by FastAPI can be accessed at `/docs` when running Panoptikon, for example at `http://127.0.0.1:6342/docs` by default. Alternatively, ReDoc can be accessed at `/redoc`, for example at `http://127.0.0.1:6342/redoc` by default.

API endpoints support specifying the name of the `index` and `user_data` databases to use, regardless of what databases are specified in environment variables (see below).

This is done through the `index_db` and `user_data_db` query parameters. If not specified, the databases specified in environment variables are used by default.

## 🛠 Installation

This project uses [**UV**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management — a Python package manager that works with `pyproject.toml`.

### ✅ Prerequisites

Install **UV**:

#### macOS (via Homebrew)

```bash
brew install astral-sh/uv/uv
```

#### Ubuntu / Linux

```bash
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
```

You must also have Python 3.8–3.12 installed. We recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) for managing Python versions.

---

## 💻 Installing the Project

> ❗ You may have to re-run the `uv pip install` command **any time** panoptikon is updated

### macOS / Linux

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install --group inference
```

This will create a virtual environment in `.venv` and install all dependencies, including the inference server.

---

### Windows (with NVIDIA GPU acceleration)

If you want to run inference on GPU (CUDA), install PyTorch with the appropriate CUDA wheels:

```powershell
uv venv
. .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

uv pip install --group inference --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

This ensures `torch`, `torchvision`, and `torchaudio` are installed with **CUDA 12.4** support.

> 💡 Make sure your system has the matching CUDA runtime installed. See [PyTorch's CUDA compatibility table](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for guidance.

### Windows (CPU only)

```powershell
uv venv
. .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uv pip install --group inference
```

This installs the CPU versions of all dependencies. If you're **not running the inference server** on this machine, you can omit the `--group inference` flag.

## 🌐 Running Inference on a Separate Server

If you're running the inference server on a **different machine**, you can omit the `--group inference` flag during installation and set the `INFERENCE_API_URL` environment variable to point to the server before running Panoptikon:

```bash
export INFERENCE_API_URL=http://inference-server:5000
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
$env:INFERENCE_API_URL = "http://inference-server:5000"
```

Every Panoptikon instance exposes the inference server API by default, which means you can point `INFERENCE_API_URL` to another Panoptikon instance to leverage its inference server.

> 💡 This is useful if you have a powerful machine with a GPU running the inference server + Panoptikon, and a less powerful machine without a GPU running only Panoptikon's core, for example, a desktop and a laptop.

### Other Dependency Issues

#### cuDNN

When running the Whisper implementation, which is based on [CTranslate2](https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2/), you may see errors related to cuDNN libraries. Download a version 8.x cuDNN package appropriate for your system from [Nvidia](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cudnn/redist/cudnn/), unpack the archive, and save its contents inside the `cudnn` directory at the root of this repo.

Make sure the `cudnn` folder contains `bin`, `lib`, `include`, etc., as direct subfolders.

If you still encounter issues with cuDNN, you may need to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to point to the cuDNN library `bin` folder.

In order to do this, edit or create a file called just `.env` in the root of this repository and add the following line:

```env
LD_LIBRARY_PATH='cudnn/bin':$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

See issue: https://github.com/reasv/panoptikon/issues/5

#### WeasyPrint

This is only relevant if you intend to use Panoptikon with HTML files. Panoptikon uses [WeasyPrint](https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/stable/index.html) to handle HTML files. You have to follow their [Installation Guide](https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/stable/first_steps.html#installation) to ensure all the external dependencies are present on your system. If they are present but not found, it's recommended to set the `WEASYPRINT_DLL_DIRECTORIES` environment variable to point to the correct folder.

#### enable_load_extension

```
AttributeError: 'sqlite3.Connection' object has no attribute 'enable_load_extension'
```

The SQLite version bundled with your python install doesn't support extensions.
You need to install a version of SQLite that supports them.

## Running Panoptikon

Ensure the virtual environment is activated:

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
. .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### macOS / Linux

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Running the Server

Then run the following command to start the server:

```bash
panoptikon
```

This will start Panoptikon along with its inference server, listening by default at `http://127.0.0.1:6342/` (API).

Everything except for adding new AI models and customizing existing ones can be done through the Next.js UI available at `http://127.0.0.1:6339` by default.

## First Steps

Open the home page of the web UI and follow the instructions to get started. You'll have to add directories to the list of allowed paths and then run the file scan job to index the files in those directories. Before being able to search, you'll also have to run data extraction jobs to extract text, tags, and other metadata from the files.

## Bookmarks

You can bookmark any search result by clicking on the bookmark button on each thumbnail. Bookmarks are stored in a separate database and can be accessed through the API, as well as through search.

To search in your bookmarks, open Advanced Search and enable the bookmarks filter, which will show you only the items you've bookmarked.

Bookmarks can belong to one or more groups, which are essentially tags that you can use to organize your bookmarks. You can create new groups by typing an arbitrary name in the Group field in Advanced Search and selecting it as the current group, then bookmarking an item.

## Adding More Models

See `config/inference/example.toml` for examples on how to add custom models from Hugging Face to Panoptikon.

## Environment Variables and Config

Panoptikon accepts environment variables as config options. It uses dotenv, so you can create a file called `.env` in this folder with all the environment variables and their values, and it will be automatically applied at runtime.

### HOST and PORT

Default:

```env
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=6342
```

These determine where to bind the Panoptikon server, which delivers both the inference API and the search and configuration UI.

**Warning:** Do not expose Panoptikon to the internet without a reverse proxy and authentication. It is designed as a local service and does not have any security features.

### INFERIO_HOST, INFERIO_PORT

Default:

```env
INFERIO_HOST=127.0.0.1
INFERIO_PORT=7777
```

These **only** apply when the inference server (`inferio`) is run separately as a standalone application without Panoptikon. They determine where to bind the inference server, which runs the models.

To run the inference server separately, you can run `inferio` (ensure the venv is activated).

### INFERENCE_API_URL

Default: Not set.

If you're running the inference server separately, you can point this to the URL of the inference server to allow Panoptikon to use it.

By default, a Panoptikon instance will run its own inference server, which also means that you can point `INFERENCE_API_URL` to another Panoptikon instance to leverage its inference server.

For example, you might have a full Panoptikon instance running on your desktop or workstation, and another instance running on your laptop without a GPU. You can point the laptop instance to the desktop instance's inference server to leverage the GPU.

Simply configure the desktop instance to run the inference server on an IP reachable from the laptop, and set `INFERENCE_API_URL` to the URL of the desktop instance's inference server, for example `http://192.168.1.16:6342`. Don't add a trailing slash.

### DATA_FOLDER

Default:

```env
DATA_FOLDER=data
```

Where to store the databases and logs. Defaults to "data" inside the current directory.

### LOGLEVEL

Default:

```env
LOGLEVEL=INFO
```

The log level for the logger. You can find the log file under `[DATA_FOLDER]/panoptikon.log`.

### INDEX_DB, USER_DATA_DB

Default:

```env
INDEX_DB=default
USER_DATA_DB=default
```

The names of the default databases to use for indexing (files and extracted data) and user data (bookmarks). These are the databases that are used by default when no database is specified in the API request. Regardless of what databases are specified in the environment variables, the API endpoints support specifying the database to use through the `index_db` and `user_data_db` query parameters, and the UI allows the creation of new index databases and the selection of which index database to use for search and other operations.

### TEMP_DIR

Default:

```env
TEMP_DIR=./data/tmp
```

Where to store temporary files. Defaults to `./data/tmp`. These files are generally short-lived and are cleaned up automatically, but if you're running out of space on `./data/tmp` you can set this to a different location.

### SHOW_IN_FM_COMMAND, OPEN_FILE_COMMAND

Default: Not set.

Panoptikon includes APIs to open files in the file manager or in the default application for the file type. These are used in the UI to allow you to open the file in your file manager or in the default application for the file type.

Panoptikon has sane defaults for each platform (Windows, Linux, macOS), but you can override these by setting the `SHOW_IN_FM_COMMAND` and `OPEN_FILE_COMMAND` environment variables to your custom commands.

The strings `{path}`, `{folder}`, `{filename}` within your command will be replaced with the full path to the file, the folder containing the file, and the filename with extension, respectively.

You can also set these commands to no-ops by setting them to something like `echo {path}` or `echo {filename}` in order to disable the functionality. **_This is absolutely necessary if you intend to expose Panoptikon to the internet, as the default commands are shell commands that can be used to execute arbitrary code on your machine. By default, this effectively allows remote code execution as a service._**

### ENABLE_CLIENT

Default:

```env
ENABLE_CLIENT=true
```

Whether to run the Next.js UI. If you're running Panoptikon in a headless environment, you can set this to `false` to disable the UI and only run the API server, then host the UI separately.

You can still access the API documentation at `/docs` and `/redoc` even if the UI is disabled.

### CLIENT_HOST, CLIENT_PORT

Default:

```env
CLIENT_HOST=HOST
CLIENT_PORT=6339
```

Where to bind the Next.js UI. Defaults to the same host as the API server and port 6339.

### DISABLE_CLIENT_UPDATE

Default:

```env
DISABLE_CLIENT_UPDATE=false
```

Whether to disable the automatic update of the Next.js UI.

You can set this to `true` to disable the automatic update of the UI when the server is restarted. If this is set to the default `false`, Panoptikon will `git pull` the latest version of the UI on startup from the repository's "master" branch.

This might break Panoptikon if the UI is not compatible with the current version of the server. If you're not planning on constantly keeping Panoptikon up to date, you should set this to `true` after the first run to prevent the UI from being updated to a version that is incompatible with the server.

After every update, you can set it to `false` again once to allow the UI to be updated on the next restart.
